## Ceaser's Cypher Decryption Project

In this project, I have been engaged as a security consultant tasked with encrypting and decrypting company X's internal messages.

### Analogy

Ceaser's Cypher is considered as the simplest and most widely used encryption and decryption methods.

### Methodology

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
